    <title>Harassment Situation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>I've been a target of violent harassment for over six months.</p>
        <ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>There is gas being let into my apartment.</li>
            <li>There is some toxic liquid dropping from the ceiling.</li>
            <li>People are following me and threatening me every time I go out.</li>
            <li>There is gas being used that makes you fall asleep, without even noticing it, basically physically controlling me.</li>
            <li>My right to health care services has been blocked from me multiple times.</li>
            <li>It has been made impossible for me to be working from home, and at the same time it has been made sure I cannot leave the house without being harassed on the streets and in the public transport.</li>
                </ul>
</ol>
        <p>The aim of all this has been to get some kind of sick revenge by</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Making me doubt my own sanity by using different means and mind games.</li>
            <li>Making people around me think I'm crazy.</li>
            <li>Spreading things about me that would cause general hate towards me and gather an angry mob against me.</li>
        </ul>
<p>I have been to mosses 3 times already (more about that below), they have sent me to guardia urbana, from there back to mosses etc. The first time I went to mosses, there was a guy on the terrace of the neighbouring bar (the owner is the main player here), talking to someone (making sure I hear it), saying that "<em>when he gets there, just send him away..."</em> and that's exactly what happened, coincidence or not. As it seems obvious that there is no interest in this there, and if policia national cannot help me, I hope the story sparks an interest in the press, as this really is something that no one ever would think that would happen. For sure in that case the end result won't look good to me, but neither will it for the Spanish legal system.</p>
<p>Everything in the events show that the only thing these people really wanted to do was put on a big show at my expense. Had this really been about drug use in the apartment, I assume someone would have said something to me or for example to the building administrator before starting this scheme.</p>
<p>This thing has basically ruined my life, work and apartment, and I cannot leave it like that. I have no problem leaving Barcelona, but I need everyone to pay for their tonterias before that since the motive for the people behind this has not been what they are saying. Additionally, these are all people that have had some issue with me since day one, and now they have grouped and put together this:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p>It started already in September/October last year, when I noticed something strange in the air in the flat and bought an air quality meter. For a long time, it was not showing anything abnormal except for occasional sudden rises in VOC and PM2.5 values, but then at some point towards the end of the year I had a cough which probably was pneumonia caused by the gases. I even heard the woman from the next building talking to someone about it with a tone that showed she knew what had caused it.</p>
<p>She is a person living in the next building, she has always had some issue with me and been talking shit to everyone, most likely she is also behind throwing eggs on the terrace whenever I would have people over for some kind of gathering at night. It started going worse after I was living alone here; passive-aggressive talking with some Italian guys (whose faces I have never seen), trying to make it impossible for me to use the terrace, talking to all neighbors explaining I'm crazy, just sitting here all day without doing anything, and when some neighbor commented to her that I'm working from home, she started screaming like crazy that I'm not working.</p>
<p>Additionally, all her communication was also very homophobic, like calling me <em>"la vecina"</em> etc. Her behavior escalated when I was on the terrace maybe 2 summers ago and she was screaming to two young girls she had working for her (to my understanding), they even closed the door, but in any case, as she was going completely mental, I heard it clearly until the terrace.</p>
<p>Many nights I have heard her so drunk she can hardly speak, so most likely she is thinking I hear too much being on the terrace so much and she started with strange excuses like <em>"I cannot stand childish people"</em> when there were toys on the terrace after having my niece and friends from Finland visiting with their children, she was on the balcony going on about how there are toys but where are the children, as if she would not have known why the toys were there.</p>
<p>She was also working in my building cleaning the Airbnb flats, and at some point, her son was also doing that, they would for example pretend to have conversations like <em>"they say the flat is really nice, but the guy is.."</em> I never really stayed to listen for a long time. When she would see me on the terrace she would call her kids saying <em>"el chico de local esta aqui"</em> and then the kids would show up and start saying something retarded. The woman surely has some psychopathic tendencies and I imagine that she has been the one basically putting everything in motion.</p>
<p>Same tendencies seem to have the woman who lives above my apartment on the terrace side. Since the day they moved in I've heard <em>"marikon"</em> a million times and could imagine she is another of the masterminds behind this thing. Their own life until this show started, basically followed a formula of getting drunk/high on Friday, going out and then normally Fernando would come back alone after some fight, then hours of <em>"yo no tango relacion!" "porfavor, porfavor!"</em> being literally screamed, waking me up every weekend around 5-6, and then at some point the woman would come back and she would have loud sex, strangely always only heard her, never Fernando, think it was her power play and foreplay her twisted mind needed to get going.</p>
<p>Among other things, that she probably didn't mean for me to hear, were those nights that she came home after the fights, I could hear her on the balcony on the phone talking to someone, making it obvious she has the "plata" and she is in charge. When this thing started, she was also the person who ran on the street, pretending to be crying and in shock, saying that there is gas being put in her flat, while in reality it was just her, putting it in my flat. At this stage they thought that I cannot go to the police because of my work (even heard them talking about this on the balcony) which makes the whole thing even more twisted. Additionally, while trying to go upstairs to talk, instead of opening the door, she was pretending to be having sex.</p>
<p>One of the weirdest things that have happened was when I was traveling to Torrevieja to my parent's place, suddenly the flight that's normally not busy at all, was overbooked. There were probably 20 of these people on the flight, talking so that I obviously could hear them, for example in front of me in the queue a guy was talking about the situation and saying, "how do you solve this.." missed some parts but in the end, he said "<em>we will buy the apartment"</em> And a guy in Vueling uniform at the gate (when waiting to see who of the overbooked people can board the plane) said to the flight attendant that <em>"Anton es mi amigo"</em> making sure I will board the plane. I have no idea who that person is. In this queue it was also said that going to the police would be a bad idea, and later in Torrevieja "<em>"bad things will happen""</em></p>
<p>In Alicante I hurried out of the plane and was thinking it's strange how no one is following me or anything like that. The moment I got in the car, my mother said that in the upstairs flat they have been drilling so much it sounded like they're coming through to our flat, and that's when I knew these people had been there too already. in the apartment of 70 something years old people who have nothing to do with this topic.</p>
<p>In a restaurant there I heard the waitress saying "esta aqui" and the same talking continued making sure I overhear who they are. Also in La Cau an hour away from Torrevieja, the same people were there, casually passing by saying things that made it clear who they were. Same repeated everywhere we would go, and it has continued until this day, I cannot leave the house without these people shading me. The <em>â€œesta aqui" or "es el"</em> that I have heard in most shops, restaurants etc where I've gone to, has spread so wide, that the request to do it must have come from someone in a high position in this city.</p>
<p>There are also cameras in the apartment as they know everything that I have been doing, including visits to the toilet and other personal activities, and this is the information they use outside home; they pretend to have conversations so that I hear them and include in the conversations these things from home with some threat related to them.</p>
<p>All this time my phone and laptop have been hacked, every single message and keystroke has been tracked and I suppose also my parents' phones have been tampered with. The photos and videos I had gathered have been erased in front of my eyes. All this would definitely fit in with Fred, Fred is a narcissistic person who wanted to get married with me, and as that didn't happen, his plan was to probably control me with a shared dog. When even that didn't work out, we ended up in this situation where he has teamed with the neighbors to create this plan.</p>
<p>Also, says a lot about these people that while I was trying to air out the flat when there was gas coming from the upstairs apartment, a woman brought her child there in front of the open door and said <em>"Respira profundo y nos vamos"</em>, just to make me close the door.</p>
<p>When I tried to go to CAP to get tests done for the toxins, once again I was sent from CAP to CUAP and vice versa. Also, when I made an appointment at Sanitas, I was appointed a doctor who then changed, and doctor Wendy then completely ignored everything I said and basically had a monologue where she described symptoms and gave a diagnosis based on that, blocking my access to the tests.</p>
<p>At the start, both of the upstairs neighbours were pouring some kind of liquid form toxic in the empty spaces in the vault ceiling which then evaporates into the flat, or filled the space with some lighter than air gas that then entered the flat. Soon after that they started to use the tubes that are for protecting electrical wires, when checking with the air quality meter the readings were tens or hundreds of times higher than the air inside the flat.</p>
<p>The gases are also being somehow pushed from the restaurant kitchen with some system that creates pressure and it enters the apartment through some pipes and then gets released inside the walls all over the flat. Previously the same happened also from the street side apartment above me, the pressure used is so high that it makes even the floor vibrate, and it has also broken a floor tile and caused water to surface from the joints of the tiles.</p>
<p>This is the part where the whole story turns into something extremely difficult to believe: lately the use of gas has turned into the use of some kind of toxic liquids, and to do this they use some kind of device capable of transferring liquids and puncturing different materials. The walls and ceilings here are full of spots, where I suppose in the center, there is a camera and the surroundings are full of canals with something toxic. The brick walls are FULL of white spots that have been created when they have been filling the tunnels made by this device.</p>
</ul>
<p><strong>The house is full of evidence from floor to ceiling. I just need someone to come and verify it.</strong></p>
