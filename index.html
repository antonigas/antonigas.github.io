Churros, Federica, shops etc. everyone seems to know who I am, and they have changed their behaviour, i've heard “Es el” 100 times lately
            
This has started already in September/October last year, that when I noticed something strange in the air in the flat and  bought an air quality meter. For long time it was not showing anything abnormal except for occasional sudden rises in voc and pm2.5, but then at some point towards the end of the year I had a couch that probably was pneumonia caused by the gases. I even hear the borracha amargada talk to someone about it with a tone, that showed she knew what had caused it. She is the person living in the next building, she has always had some issue with me and been talking shit to everyone she could,  probably she is also behind throwing eggs on the terrace whenever I would have people over for some kind of gathering at night. 

It started going worse after I was living alone here, e.g. passive aggressive talking with some Italian guys who's faces i have never seen, trying to make it impossible for me to use the terrace. Talking to all neighbours explaining I’m crazy, just sitting here all day without doing anything, and when for example some neighbour told her that I’m working from home, she started screaming like crazy that “he is not working!!” like a complete lunatic. There was also an incident when the same construction guys who had done my renovation was working on the neighbouring house, she was once again  going on about “how its just bajos” etc etc and when the construction guy said to her that in that bajos they really have it all, i could hear her losing her mind over the comment..

[renovation worker commenting the apartment] Additionally, all the communication was also very homophobic, like calling me “la vecina” etc. Her behavior escalated when I was on the terrace maybe 2 summers ago and she was screaming to two young girls she had working for her (to my understanding), she even closed the door, but in any case, as she was going completely mental, I heard it clearly until the terrace. Many nights I have heard her so drunk she can hardly speak, so most likely she is thinking I hear too much being on the terrace so much and she started with strange excuses like “I cannot stand childish people” when there was toys on the terrace after having  my niece and friends from Finland visiting with their children, she was on the balcony going on about how there's toys but where are the children, as if she would not have known why the toys were there. She was also working in my building cleaning the flats of Jon at some point,also her son was doing that, they would for example pretend to have conversations like e.g.“they say the flat is really nice, but the guy is..” never really stayed to listen for long time. 
When she would see  me on the terrace she would call her kids saying “el chico de local esta aqui” and then the kids would show up and start saying something retarded. In the beginning i actually thought that they are a “special needs family” but unfortunately they’re just bitter and sad people, and the woman surely has some psychopathic tendensies.

Igually psycho is the the mexican chica who lives above my apartment on the terrace side. Since the day they moved in I’ve heard “marikon” million times and i could imagine she is one of the masterminds behind this thing. Their own life until this show started, basically followed a formula of getting drunk/high on friday, going out and them normally poor Fernando would come back alone after some fight, then hours of “yo no tango relacion!” “porfavor porfavor” being literally screamed, waking me up every weekend around 5-6, and then at some point the chica would come back and she would have loud sex, strangely always only heard her, never Fernando, think it was her power play and foreplay her twisted mind needed to get going.
Im 100% sure she is only using Fernando in many way she can, those nights that she came home after the fights, I could hear her on the balcony on the phone talking to someone, making it obvious she has the “plata” and she is in charge.

Then theres ***, the stupid retarded fat cunt.  
[GUY IN THE VIDEO]

When I was travelling to Torrevieja to my parent's place, suddenly the flight that’s normally not busy at all was overbooked. There was probably 20 of these people on the flight, talking so that I obviously could hear them, for example in front of me in the queue a guy was talking about the situation and saying, “how do you solve this..” I missed some parts but in the end, he said “we will buy the apartment” There's these people working in Vueling,a guy in Vueling uniform at the gate when waiting to see who of the over booked people can board the plane said to the flight attendant that “Anton es miamigo” making sure I will board the plane.
In this same situation i was also told that it will be a bad idea to go to police with this. 
In Alicante I hurried out of the plane and was thinking why no one is following me or anything like that, but the moment I got in the car, my mother said that in the upstairs flat they have been drilling so much it sounds they're coming through to their flat, and that’s when I knew they had been there too already. 

I assume also my parent's car had been tampered, there was some kind of gas coming there too, and the sounnd is very specific if you have  good hearign it caannot be missed , really not sure why my parents didn’t notice it. The car was always dripping water from below whenever we would park, it has never before happened, and I would assume that it was because gas bottles gets really cold when theyre used and it creates condensation water in hot air. This water dripping then stopped the last day when i was leaving and my parents took me to the airport. 
In restaurant Ciancomo I Heard the waitress saying “esta aqui” and the same talking continued making sure I “overhear” who they are. In La Cau an hour away from torre, the same people were there, casually passing by saying things that made it clear who they were.'
Same repeated everywhere we would go.
After returning from torre, oneSunday we did a short hike on a hill in Montcada i Reixac, in the train I already noticed persons from the same group of people entering and sitting close, talking so I could hear them, and then on the mountain they were there on a lookout spot in bigger group.

Happening at home
the uspstairs mexicans are pouring somekind of liquid form toxic in the empty spaces in the vault ceiling which them evaporates into the flat. 
There has been different gases scoming from the tubes that are used to protect electrical wires, its also being somehow pushed from the restaurant kitchen with soem system that creates pressure and it enters through the walls and prevuiously same happened also from the indian apartment. 

The strange comment from woman with her partner “they have a plot against they guy in that flat pointing at indian flat”
“Respiraprofundo y nosvamos”to a kid about breathing air with toxic gas
