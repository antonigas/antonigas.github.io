<p>I&apos;** been a target of violent harassment for over 6 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>***** is gas being let **** my apartment. There some toxic liquid dropping from *** ceiling. People are ********* ** and *********** ** every time I go out. There is *** being used that makes you fall asleep, without even noticing it, basically ********** attacking me. ** right to health **** services has been ******* from me ******** times. It has been made impossible for me ** be working **** home, and at the same time it has been made sure I cannot leave the ***** without being harassed on the streets and in the ****** transport.</p>
<p>The aim of *** **** *** been ** get some **** of sick ******* by&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>making me think I&apos;m crazy&nbsp;</li>
    <li>making people ****** me think I&apos;m crazy&nbsp;</li>
    <li>spreading things about me that ***** cause general **** towards me</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been to mosses 3 ***** already (**** about **** below), **** have **** ** to guardia urbana, from there back to ****** etc. *** ***** time I **** to mosses, ***** was a guy on *** terrace ** *** neighbouring bar (the owner is *** main player here), ******* ** someone (****** sure i hear it), saying that &ldquo;when ** gets there, just send *** away&hellip;&rdquo; and that&apos;s exactly what happened, coincidence ** not. As it ***** obvious that there ** ** interest in this there, and If policia nacional cannot help me, I **** *** story sparks an interest in *** press, as this really ** something **** no *** **** would ***** that ***** happen. For sure ** that **** the end result won&rsquo;t **** good to me, but neither will it for *** Spanish ***** system.</p>
<p>Everything in the ****** show **** the only thing these ****** really ****** ** do was *** on a big show at my expense. Had this really been ***** drug use in the apartment, I assume someone would have **** ********* to ** ** *** ******* ** the ******** administrator ****** starting **** scheme. This thing *** basically ruined my life, work and apartment, and I cannot leave ** like that. I have no ******* leaving Barcelona, but I need everyone ** pay *** their tonterias before that since the motive for *** ****** behind this has not been **** they are saying. Additionally, these are all ****** **** **** *** some ***** **** me since day one, and now **** have grouped and put together this: &nbsp;</p>
<p>** ******* already ** September/October last year, when I ******* something strange in the *** ** the **** and ****** an air quality meter. For long **** it *** *** showing anything abnormal ****** for occasional ****** rises in *** and PM2.5 values, but **** at **** point towards the end of *** **** I *** a ***** ***** probably was ********* ****** by the gases. I **** ***** the woman from **** building talking to someone about ** with a tone, **** showed she knew what *** caused it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is a ****** living ** the **** building, she *** always *** some ***** with ** and **** ******* **** ** ******** *** could,she probably is **** behind throwing **** on the terrace whenever I ***** have people over *** **** kind ** gathering at night. It started ***** worse ***** I was living alone here, ******* aggressive talking **** some Italian **** who&apos;s faces i have ***** seen, trying to **** it impossible *** ** to use *** terrace. Talking to all neighbours explaining I&rsquo;m crazy, just ******* here all *** without doing anything, and when for example some neighbour told *** I&rsquo;m working from home, she ******* ********* like ***** that I&rsquo;m *** working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, *** *** communication was also very homophobic, like calling me &ldquo;** vecina&rdquo; etc. Her behaviour escalated when I *** ** the ******* maybe 2 ******* ago and she was screaming ** two young girls *** had working for her (** my understanding), she even closed *** door, but in any case, as she *** going ********** mental, I heard it clearly until the terrace.</p>
<p>Many ****** I have ***** her so drunk she can hardly speak, ** most likely she is ******** I hear *** much being on the terrace so much and she started with strange ******* like &ldquo;I cannot stand childish people&rdquo; **** there was **** ** the ******* after having my ***** and friends from Finland ******** with their children, she was on the balcony going on about *** there&apos;s toys but ***** are the children, as if *** would not **** known why *** **** were there. She was also working in my building cleaning the airbnb flats at **** point,also her *** *** ***** that, they ***** for ******* pretend to have ************* like &ldquo;they say the **** ** really nice, but the guy is..&rdquo; I never ****** stayed to listen *** long time. **** *** would see ** on the terrace she would **** her **** saying &ldquo;** ***** de local esta aqui&rdquo; and then *** kids would show up and start saying something retarded. The ***** ****** has some psychopathic ********** and I imagine that she has been the one basically ******* ********** in motion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>**** tendencies **** to have the mexican woman who lives above my ********* ** *** terrace side. Since the day they moved in I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;marikon&rdquo; ******* ***** *** i ***** imagine she is another of the masterminds behind this thing. Their own **** until this **** started, ********* followed a ******* of getting drunk/high on Friday, going out and them normally Fernando would come **** ***** ***** **** fight, then hours of &ldquo;yo ** ***** relacion!&rdquo; &ldquo;porfavor porfavor&rdquo; being ********* screamed, ****** me ** ***** weekend around 5-6, and **** at **** ***** *** woman ***** come back and she would **** loud sex, strangely ****** only ***** her, never Fernando, think it was *** power play and ******** her twisted mind needed ** get going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>***** ***** things, that she probably didn&rsquo;t **** *** me to hear, **** ***** nights that she came home ***** *** fights, I could **** her on the balcony ** the phone ******* to someone, making it obvious she has *** &ldquo;plata&rdquo; *** *** is in charge. When this thing started, she *** also the person who ran on the street, ********** to be ****** and in shock, saying that ***** is gas being *** in her flat, ***** ** reality ** was just her, putting it ** ** flat. At this stage they ******* that i ****** go ** *** police (**** heard them talking ***** this on the balcony) which ***** *** ***** thing even more twisted. Additionally, while ****** to go upstairs to talk, instead of ******* *** door, she *** ********** ** ** having sex.</p>
<p>One ** the weirdest ****** that have happened was when I was travelling to Torrevieja to my parent&apos;s place, suddenly the flight that&rsquo;s normally not **** ** all, *** overbooked.There was probably 20 of ***** people on the flight, talking ** that I ********* could hear them, for example in front of ** in the ***** a guy was ******* about *** situation and saying, &ldquo;how do you solve this..&rdquo; ****** **** parts but in *** end, ** said &ldquo;** will buy *** apartment&rdquo; And a &nbsp;guy in Vueling uniform ** *** **** (when waiting to *** who of the ********** people can ***** the plane) said ** *** flight ********* that &ldquo;Anton ** mi amigo&rdquo; making sure I will board *** plane.I **** ** **** who that person is. ** **** ***** it was **** said that going ** the ****** would ** a *** idea, *** later in Torrevieja &ldquo;bad things will happen&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ******** I hurried out ** the plane and was thinking its strange *** no one is following me or anything like that. *** ****** I *** in the car, my ****** said **** ** the upstairs **** they have been drilling so much it ******* like they&apos;re ****** through to our flat, and that&rsquo;s **** I knew ***** people had been ***** too already. in *** apartment ** 70 something years old ****** who have nothing ** do with this topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a restaurant I heard the waitress saying &ldquo;esta aqui&rdquo; and the same talking ********* making sure I &ldquo;overhear&rdquo; who they are. Also ** ** Cau an hour away **** Torrevieja, the same people were there, casually passing by saying things **** made ** clear who **** were. **** repeated ********** we would go, *** it has continued until this day, I ****** ***** *** ***** without ***** ****** shading me. *** &ldquo;esta aqui&rdquo; or &ldquo;es el&rdquo; **** I have ***** in most shops, restaurants *** where I&rsquo;** gone to, has spread ** wide, that the request to ** it must have **** from ******* ** a **** position in this city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also cameras in *** ********* as they know everything that i **** been doing, including visits ** the toilet and other ******** activities, and this ** the information they use ******* home; **** ******* to have conversations so **** i **** them and include ** the conversations these things **** home with some threat ******* to them. VIEO/SOUND</p>
<p>All **** **** my phone and laptop have been hacked, every single message and keystroke has been tracked and i suppose also my parents phones have been tampered. This ***** definably *** in with Fred, Fred ** a ************ person who wanted ** get married **** me, and as that didn&apos;t happen, his plan was to probably control me **** a shared dog, When &nbsp;even **** didn&apos;t work out, we ended ** in **** situation ***** he has teamed **** the neighbours to ****** **** plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also says a *** ***** these ****** that while I *** ****** to air out *** flat when there was gas coming from the upstairs apartment, a woman brought her child ***** in front of *** open door and said &ldquo;******* ******** y nos vamos&rdquo;, just ** make me close *** door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i tried ** ** to CAP to get ***** done for the toxins, once again i was sent **** CAP to **** *** vice versa. **** when i made ** appointment ** Sanitas, i *** appointed a doctor *** then &nbsp;changed, and ***** **** completely ignored everything i **** and ********* *** a monolog where she described symptoms *** gave &nbsp;a ********* based on that, ******** my access ** the tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>** *** start *** uspstairs mexicans and indians **** pouring **** kind of liquid **** toxic ** the empty ****** ** the vault ceiling which them ********** into the flat, or filled the space **** some lighter than air *** that then entered the flat. Soon after that they ******* to *** *** tubes that are for protecting electrical wires, when checking with the air quality ***** the reading **** tens or ******** ***** higher **** the air inside *** flat.</p>
<p>The ***** are also ***** ******* pushed from the ********** ******* with some system that creates pressure *** it ****** the apartment ******* some pipes and **** **** ******** ****** *** walls *** over *** flat. Previously same happened also from the indian apartment, *** pressure used ** so high that it makes **** the floor vibrate, and it *** also broken a ***** tile and caused water to surface from *** ****** of *** tiles. *** ***** in the floor tile is only visible ****** this vibration,&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the **** ***** the ***** story turns into ********* extremely ********* to believe: ****** the use of gas has turned **** *** ** some kind of toxic liquids, and ** this they use some kind of device capable of transferring liquids and ********** different materials. The ***** and ceilings here are **** of spots, where I suppose in the centre ***** is a ****** and the surroundings are **** of canals **** ********* toxic. The ***** walls are **** of ***** spots that have been created when they **** been filling *** ******* **** by this device. The ***** is full of evidence from ***** to ceiling, I **** **** some professional to **** and verify it.&nbsp;</p>
